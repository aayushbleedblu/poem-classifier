# poem-classifier

Implemented a solution using the logic programming paradigm in SWI-Prolog.  The aim of the project was to automatically detect the presence of a japanese haiku, doha and quatret. Code was structured to identify and flag the complex rhyming schemes of japanese poetry. This project was completed for the partial fulfilment of the course Logic in Computer Science in BITS Pilani.
